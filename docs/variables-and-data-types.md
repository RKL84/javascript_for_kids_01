## Variables and Data Types

#### What are variables used for in programming?
Variables are used to store and manage data. They give names to values so we can use them later.

#### How can you declare variables?
You can declare a variable using the `let` keyword. For example: `let age = 8;`.

#### Data types: strings, numbers, booleans.
- Strings: Used for text. For example: `"Hello, World!"`.
- Numbers: Used for numeric values. For example: `42`, `3.14`.
- Booleans: Used for true/false values. For example: `true`, `false`.

#### How can you change the value of a variable?
You can assign a new value to a variable using the assignment operator `=`. For example: `age = 9;`.

#### What's the difference between `let`, `const`, and `var`?
- `let`: Used to declare variables that can be reassigned.
- `const`: Used to declare variables that cannot be reassigned.
- `var`: Similar to `let`, but has some differences in scope behavior.

#### Can you concatenate strings?
Yes! You can concatenate (join) strings using the `+` operator. For example: `"Hello, " + "World!"`.

#### Q & A:
- Q: What are variables used for?
- A: Variables are used to store and manage data in programming.

- Q: How do you declare a variable?
- A: You declare a variable using the `let` keyword, followed by the variable name and optional initial value.

- Q: What's the difference between strings and numbers?
- A: Strings hold text, while numbers hold numeric values for calculations.

**Challenges:**
1. Create a program that calculates the area of a rectangle using variables.
2. Write a program that uses string concatenation to create a sentence about your favorite food.
