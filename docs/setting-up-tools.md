## Setting Up the Tools

#### What do you need to get started?
To start coding with JavaScript, you'll need a code editor. We recommend using Visual Studio Code (VS Code) as it's user-friendly and powerful.

#### Installing Visual Studio Code
1. **Download**: Visit the [VS Code website](https://code.visualstudio.com/) and download the installer for your operating system.
2. **Install**: Run the installer and follow the on-screen instructions.

#### Adding JavaScript Extensions
VS Code provides extensions that enhance your coding experience. Here are a few helpful extensions for JavaScript development:

- **JavaScript (ES6) Code Snippets**: Provides shortcuts for common JavaScript code patterns.
- **ESLint**: Helps you follow coding standards and catch errors in your code.
- **Prettier - Code Formatter**: Automatically formats your code to keep it clean and consistent.
- **Live Server**: Launches a live web server for easy HTML and JavaScript testing.

#### How to Open Your Project in VS Code
1. **Open VS Code**: Launch Visual Studio Code.
2. **Create a New Folder**: Create a new folder where you'll store your HTML, CSS, and JavaScript files.
3. **Open Folder**: In VS Code, click "File" > "Open Folder" and select the folder you created.

#### Creating HTML and JavaScript Files
1. **Create HTML File**: Right-click the folder in VS Code's file explorer, select "New File," and name it `index.html`.
2. **Create JavaScript File**: Inside the same folder, right-click again, select "New File," and name it `script.js`.
