## Conditional Statements (If-Else)

#### What are conditional statements?

Conditional statements allow your program to make decisions based on conditions. If a condition is met, a certain code block is executed.

#### How does an `if` statement work?

An `if` statement checks if a condition is true. If it is, the code block inside the `if` statement is executed.

#### Using `else if` and `else`

You can use `else if` to check additional conditions when the previous ones are not met. `else` provides a default action if none of the conditions are true.

#### Can you provide an example of using an `if` statement?

Sure! Here's an example:

```javascript
let score = 85;
if (score >= 90) {
  console.log("Great job!");
}
```

How can you use an if statement to make decisions?
You can use if statements to create interactive quizzes, validate user input, and more. They help your program respond intelligently to different scenarios.

#### Q & A:

Q: What's the difference between if, else if, and else?

A: if checks one condition, else if checks additional conditions, and else provides a default action when no conditions are met.

Q: How can you use an if statement in a real-world situation?

A: An if statement could be used to check if a user has enough credits to access premium content on a website.

**Challenges:**

1. Declare a number variable with value `10`. If number is greater than 5 print `Greater than 5` else print `Less than 5`.
2. Declare a number variable with value `8`. If number is greater than 5 print `Greater than 5` else print `Less than 5`. If number is equal to `5`, then print `Number is 5`.
3. Declare a text `abc`. If text is `abc`, print `Text Found`. If text is not `abc`, then print `No Match found`;
4. Declare a text `abc`. If text is `abc` or `ABC`, print `Text Found`. If text is not `abc`, then print `No Match found`;
