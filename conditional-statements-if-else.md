## Conditional Statements (If-Else)

#### What are conditional statements?
Conditional statements allow your program to make decisions based on conditions. If a condition is met, a certain code block is executed.

#### How does an `if` statement work?
An `if` statement checks if a condition is true. If it is, the code block inside the `if` statement is executed.

#### Using `else if` and `else`
You can use `else if` to check additional conditions when the previous ones are not met. `else` provides a default action if none of the conditions are true.

#### Can you provide an example of using an `if` statement?
Sure! Here's an example:
```javascript
let score = 85;
if (score >= 90) {
    console.log("Great job!");
}
```
How can you use an if statement to make decisions?
You can use if statements to create interactive quizzes, validate user input, and more. They help your program respond intelligently to different scenarios.


#### Q & A:
Q: What's the purpose of conditional statements?

A: Conditional statements help your program make decisions based on different conditions.

Q: What's the difference between if, else if, and else?

Q: How can you use an if statement in a real-world situation?

A: An if statement could be used to check if a user has enough credits to access premium content on a website.

**Challenges:**

1. Write a program that checks if a given number is even or odd using an if statement.
2. Create a simple quiz program that gives different responses based on user answers.
