## Functions

#### What are functions used for in programming?
Functions are like mini-programs within your program. They allow you to group code together and give it a name. You can reuse functions multiple times in your program.

#### How can you declare a function in JavaScript?
You declare a function using the `function` keyword, followed by the function name and parentheses. For example:
```javascript
function greet() {
    console.log("Hello!");
}
```

How do you call a function in JavaScript?
You call a function by using its name followed by parentheses. For example: greet();.

What's the purpose of parameters in functions?
Parameters are like placeholders for values that you pass into a function. They help the function work with different inputs.

How can you return a value from a function?
You use the return keyword to specify the value a function should output. For example:

```javascript
function add(a, b) {
    return a + b;
}
```

Can you give an example of a function with parameters?
Certainly! Here's a function that greets a person by name:

```javascript
function greet(name) {
    console.log("Hello, " + name + "!");
}
```
